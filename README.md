### SSR with React & Suspense

Testing out React v18, `renderToPipeableStream` and Suspense. There's nothing being rendered client-side, this is just some testing around the new server-side features.

You can run it with:

```
npm install
npx @babel/cli index.js
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
